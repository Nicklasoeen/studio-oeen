Implemented Vercel Web Analytics for Next.js App Router Project

SUMMARY:
Successfully installed and configured Vercel Web Analytics (@vercel/analytics) for the studio-oeen Next.js project using the App Router pattern.

CHANGES MADE:

1. Installed Package:
   - Installed @vercel/analytics (^1.6.1) using npm
   - Updated web/package.json and web/package-lock.json with the new dependency

2. Modified Files:
   - web/src/app/layout.tsx
     * Added import: `import { Analytics } from "@vercel/analytics/next"`
     * Added component: `<Analytics />` inside the <body> tag after {children}

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
- The project uses Next.js 16.1.1 with App Router (app directory structure)
- Analytics component was correctly placed inside the root layout's body tag, after the children prop
- Preserved all existing code structure including Google Analytics configuration and other scripts
- ESLint validation passed with no errors

VERIFICATION:
- npm install completed successfully (1307 packages added)
- ESLint linting passed with no errors on the modified layout.tsx file
- File syntax and imports are correct
- All changes follow Next.js and Vercel Web Analytics best practices

NOTE:
The build command failed during full project build due to missing Sanity project configuration (pre-existing issue not related to these changes). The Analytics implementation itself is correct and ready to use once the Sanity environment variables are configured.

PACKAGE VERSIONS:
- @vercel/analytics: ^1.6.1
- next: 16.1.1
- react: 19.2.3
- react-dom: 19.2.3
